# odin-recipes
A Basic Recipe Website ([give it a try!](https://orgmoiro.github.io/odin-recipes/))

## Status

***This project is being actively worked upon.***

## General Info
**odin-recipes** is the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

This is a basic recipe website with a main index page and links to three different recipes. Each recipe has an image, a description, a set of ingredients, and the steps required to create the recipe. It is not pretty because it imitates concepts from [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/).
